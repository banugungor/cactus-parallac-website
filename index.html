      <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Cacti are succulent perennial plants. Cacti generally have thick
        herbaceous or woody chlorophyll-containing stems. Cacti can be
        distinguished from other succulent plants by the presence of areoles,
        small cushionlike structures with trichomes (plant hairs) and, in almost
        all species, spines or barbed bristles (glochids). Areoles are modified
        branches, from which flowers, more branches, and leaves (when present)
        may grow.

      <h2>Why you should get a cactus?</h2>
      <p>
        Indoor cactus can boost your productivity,
        <b> make you breathe better, and make you feel happy.</b> They also make
        your house feel like a home and have unique therapeutic properties. Many
        studies have been conducted to establish the effect of indoor plants on
        stress levels in humans.

      <h2>Cacti Live For A Long Time</h2>
      <p>
        Some cacti can live for more than a hundred years. Many of them usually
        slide into hibernation mode when they are not receiving enough light or
        water, which helps them survive drought conditions and extremely hot
        weather. On average, a cactus plant will live for 80 years. The Saguaro
        cactus is one of the most well-known cacti, and it lives for around 200
        years. However, domesticated cacti plants tend to be short-lived than
        those in the wild because most gardeners fail to provide their plants
        with optimum growing conditions.
